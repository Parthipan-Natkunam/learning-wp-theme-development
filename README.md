# learning-wp-theme-development
This repo contains the practice codes that I am doing in the process of learning Wordpress Theme development.

## Note:
This is not a project repository, but it contains the practice codes that I am doing to learn theme development for Wordpress CMS. 
The reason for creating this repo is that I could access my codes across devices.
